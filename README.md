## What is QA (Quality Assurance)?

Quality Assurance (QA) ensures that software meets quality standards and works as expected.
QA activities include:
- test planning
- writing test cases
- identifying and reporting bugs
- validating software functionality

The main goal of QA is to **prevent defects and improve software quality**.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) describes the stages of software development:

1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

QA is mainly involved in the **Testing phase**, but early involvement helps prevent issues before development.
